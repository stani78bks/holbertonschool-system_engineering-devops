Secured and monitored web infrastructure

Infrastructure Design

    Web Server (Nginx):
        
        Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
        Handles incoming HTTPS requests and forwards dynamic requests to the Application Server.

    Application Server:
        
        Hosts the application codebase.
        Processes dynamic requests and interacts with the database for CRUD operations.

    Database Server (MySQL):
        
        Stores persistent data used by the application.

    SSL certificate:
        
        serves www.foobar.com over HTTPS

    Load balancer HAProxy:

        Distributed traffic between 3 Web servers

    Firewall:

        Filters requests.

    Monitoring client:

        Gather information such as system metrics, application logs, and traffic patterns.


A user wants to access your website by entering www.foobar.com into their browser. Below is the step-by-step flow of how the web infrastructure processes the request:

Flow of Request:

    Step 1: DNS
        The user's browser resolves www.foobar.com to IP adresss

    Step 2: SSL
        Generates an SSL certificate for IP adress

    Step 3: HAProxy
        Distributes traffic to 3 servers

    Step 4: Firewall
        Checks the Request before sending to servers

    Step 5: Nginx
        Distributes Request to web server

    Step 6: Monitoring client
        Gather information such as system metrics, application logs, and traffic patterns.

    Step 7: Application Server 
        Processes dynamic requests and interacts with the database for CRUD operations.

    Step 8: MySQL
        Responds to App server request if necessary.
